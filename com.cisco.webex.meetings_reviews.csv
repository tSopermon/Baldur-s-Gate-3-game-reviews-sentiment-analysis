This new version no longer supports the WebEx Meet Android app. They expect you to join from the Android WebEx app instead. One of the downsides of this is that Cisco no longer supports Android 8, which happens to be the newest Android version available for my work phone. In addition the older version of that app doesn't written with the new server either. Webex meet itself, however, seems to work fine. No bugs.",3,10,44.7.1,2024-08-18 15:18:44,44.7.1

It has everything you need and could ask for in a virtual meeting app. Plus as far as I can tell it's free. I've used this app to attend court several times and I've never paid anything.

If you share one screen and it's not full size then the participants see a small screen in the middle of their viewer rather than the shared content occupying their viewer. This greatly affects the ability to share a document and take meeting notes at the same time. Zoom is better in this regard.
